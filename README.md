# alpine

This is an R/Bioconductor package for modeling and correcting fragment
sequence bias for RNA-seq transcript abundance estimation. There is a
minimal example in `vignettes/alpine.Rmd`, although we will be
creating a better example dataset and wrapper functions to simplify
the modeling steps.
