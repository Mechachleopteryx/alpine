# alpine

This is an R/Bioconductor package for modeling and correcting fragment
sequence bias for RNA-seq transcript abundance estimation. There is a
minimal example in `vignettes/alpine.Rmd`.

The code is still in development. Expect changes in the user-facing 
functions in particular, where a wrapper function will replace the 
lower-level bias modeling and abundance estimating functions in the 
current vignette.
